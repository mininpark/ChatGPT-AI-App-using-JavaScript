This is a chat application that allows users to submit messages through a form and displays them in a chat container.
The messages are displayed in chat stripes that contain a profile picture and the message itself.
The profile picture is different depending on whether the message is from the user or the bot.

This code defines a chat bot that communicates with a server through HTTP requests. When the user submits a form, the handleSubmit function is called, which sends a POST request to the server with the user's message as the body of the request. The server responds with a message from the chat bot, which is then displayed on the page.

The code also includes a loading animation that is displayed while the server is processing the request and a function that types out the chat bot's message one character at a time.
